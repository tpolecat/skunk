  // This is a tagless interface, which is just a style of programming that parameterizes everything
  // on the effect in which values are computed. So `F` here is probably something like `IO` in real
  // code but you could mock up something in some other effect like StateT maybe, if you need to
  // test error-handling code for example and want to force some weird errors to happen.

  // So anyway we can read some number of bytes or we can write some number of bytes. In both
  // cases we can time out, which will raise an error in the `F` effect.

  // So it turns out there's already an implementation of something like this, provided by fs2.
  // One difference is that it uses a thing called a `Chunk` instead of a byte array. A chunk is

  // None if the socket terminates before we have read enough bytes. So let's go with this for

  // `AsynchronousChannelGroup` which is the thing java.nio uses to complete asynchronous
  // operations. We'll just have one of these and pass it down to where it's needed.

  // So this is a good time to introduce cats.effect.Resource, if you haven't seen it.

      }

    val free: AsynchronousChannelGroup => G[Unit] =
      acg => Sync[G].delay(acg.shutdown())
